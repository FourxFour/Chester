								<p>About Me: Hi! My name is Brett Parr and I am a student currently enrolled at BCIT. I have very little web development experience, but I very much enjoy learning more and more about web development and design, as my studies continue. A little about myself: I was born in the small town of Bella Coola, British Columbia. It is a beautiful place on the north coast of BC, a town with a population of about 1500. It has some of the best heliskiing and sport fishing locations in the entire world, two activities I love to do when I am not studying or working. I work, study and live in the lower mainland, in beautiful British Columbia.
